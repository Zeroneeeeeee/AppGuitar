    <string name="terms_of_use">
        The Guitar app is provided to help users practice and simulate guitar sounds. It offers tools for finger exercises, chord practice, and trial playing, and aims to help users improve their guitar skills. The app is intended for entertainment and learning purposes and does not guarantee practice results, nor does it replace professional guidance.
        \nBy installing or using the Guitar app, users acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agreed to comply with these Terms of Use. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please stop using the app immediately.
        \nThe Guitar app does not require account registration and does not store any personal information. All operations occur entirely on the device. The app does not collect data, track user behavior, require emails or any personal identifiers, and does not send data to any server. Any settings or practice information are stored locally on the device.
        \nUsers are allowed to use the app for personal learning, entertainment, or practice purposes; use the available simulation and practice features; and provide feedback or report issues to the developer if needed. However, users are not permitted to modify, interfere with, copy, distribute, or reuse the app without permission; use the app for illegal, harmful, or disruptive purposes; reverse engineer, hack, or bypass app protection mechanisms; or use the app in a way that causes excessive noise or negatively impacts others.
        \nThe Guitar app does not include any in-app purchases, does not charge fees in any form, and all features are provided for free.
        \nAll interfaces, source code, lesson content, guitar sounds, images, and icons in the app are owned by the developer. Users are not permitted to copy, use, or distribute them for commercial purposes without authorization.
        \nThe developer is not responsible for any hand, wrist, or physical injuries resulting from incorrect practice; damages caused by using the app in unsafe environments; app malfunctions, errors, or interruptions; or data loss due to app deletion or device issues. The app is provided “as-is” without any warranties.
        \nThe developer may update the Terms of Use at any time. Continuing to use the app after the terms have been updated constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. The developer also reserves the right to suspend or terminate user access if any violations of the terms are detected.
